"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 11:29:18 -0700",Jia Tan,,"This patch adds a .editorconfig to the root directory. The
.editorconfig file integrates into most text editors and IDE's to
enforce basic styling. I chose the configurations from the project's
current styling. I am not sure if it is intentional, but the CMake
related files use spaces instead of tabs, so I reflected that in the
.editorconfig file. For more information about editorconfig and which
text editors support it, you can visit https://editorconfig.org

Thanks! I hadn't heard about this before but it sounds nice.


I think it should be fine to add these:

    charset = utf-8
    end_of_line = lf

The exception are some files under windows/vs*. Those files will
hopefully be gone in the future though. They use LF, not CR+LF but have
BOM:

    [*.vcxproj,xz_win.sln]
    charset = utf-8-bom


If the syntax is similar to gitignore, then src/ will match also
foo/bar/src/. It doesn't really matter here but I suppose /src/ is a
tiny bit more correct.


I guess it makes sense to set also indent_size = 8 because viewing the
files with any other setting will look weird when long lines are
wrapped and can editing can result in wrong word wrapping.

There are multiple indentation styles even under src. Instead of
specifying directories, how about specifying file suffixes like *.c so
it won't matter where the files are. There are .sh files with different
styles but maybe it's not that important.

I ended up with this:

---
# To use this config on your editor, follow the instructions at:
# https://editorconfig.org/

root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.c,*.h,*.S,*.map,*.sh,*.bash,Makefile*,/configure.ac,/po4a/update-po,/src/scripts/{xzless,xzmore}.in]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 8

[/src/scripts/{xzdiff,xzgrep}.in]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[CMakeLists.txt,*.cmake]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

[*.vcxproj,xz_win.sln]
charset = utf-8-bom
---

Is it good enough or did I add bad bugs? :-)

I wasn't sure how to handle potential issues with utf-8 and
translations files, compressed test files, and visual studio files,
but after a bit of research your solution looks great.


I apologize for an error in the original patch. I had only used
editorconfig files in simple projects before, so I didn't know that
curly braces are required to apply the formatting to two or more
globs. Here is the adjusted version of the editorconfig file with
those changes:

# To use this config on your editor, follow the instructions at:
# https://editorconfig.org/

root = true

[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[**{.{c,h,S,map,sh,bash},Makefile*,configure.ac,po4a/update-po,src/scripts/{xzless,xzmore}.in}]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 8

[/src/scripts/{xzdiff,xzgrep}.in]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

[{CMakeLists.txt,*.cmake}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

[{*.vcxproj,xz_win.sln}]
charset = utf-8-bom

Two questions I have are:
1. Why are xzgrep.in and xzdiff.in formatted differently than
xzless.in and xzmore.in?


2. Why do you use tab width 8 for your source files? I have no problem
with tab width 8, I'm just used to using width 4 since it's nice for
viewing several files on the same screen or for people with small
screens. Either way, it's your preference and I will follow your lead.
