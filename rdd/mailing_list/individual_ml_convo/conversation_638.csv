"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 08:14:16 -0700",Jules Maselbas,,"The XZ_DEC_BCJ macro was not defined when only selecting the ARM64 BCJ
decoder, leading to no BCJ decoder being compiled.


The macro that select XZ_DEC_BCJ if any of the BCJ decoder is selected was
missing a case for the recently added ARM64 BCJ decoder.

Also the macro `defined(XZ_DEC_ARM)` was used twice in the condition for
selecting XZ_DEC_BCJ, so this patch replaces one with XZ_DEC_ARM64.

Thanks! I kept the ordering of the filter names the same as elsewhere
in the file and in xz_dec_bcj.c.

The ARM64 filter still hasn't been submitted to Linux but it's on the
to-do list.

OK great

cool, i've just pushed the ARM64 filter to the barebox bootloader, see:
