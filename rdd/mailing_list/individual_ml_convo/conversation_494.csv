Due to architectural limitations, address space available to a single
userspace process on MIPS32 is limited to 2 GiB, not 4, even on systems
that have more physical RAM -- e.g. 64-bit systems with 32-bit
userspace, or systems that use XPA (an extension similar to x86's PAE).


So, for MIPS32, we have to impose stronger memory limits. I've chosen
2000MiB to give the process some headroom.
