Thank you for reporting this and for your patches. We made a few minor
changes to extend your patch to also compile and skip tests if
encoders, threads, or decoders were disabled, including the script
tests. These changes have been committed to master, so they will be
included in the upcoming 5.4.0 release. If we have another alpha or
beta release prior to 5.4.0, the commits will be included in those
releases too.
Thanks again for your help!

This definitely improves the situation. However, in Gentoo, we
allow optionally disabling 'extra-filters', described to users as:
```
        <flag name=""extra-filters"">Build additional filters that are not
                used in any of the default xz presets. This includes delta
                and BCJ coders, additional match finders and SHA256 
checks.</flag>
```

When this flag is disabled (i.e. no extra-filters), we pass the following
options to configure:
```
/var/tmp/portage/app-arch/xz-utils-9999/work/xz-utils-9999/configure 
--prefix=/usr --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu 
--mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --datadir=/usr/share 
--sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var/lib --disable-dependency-tracking 
--disable-silent-rules --docdir=/usr/share/doc/xz-utils-9999 
--htmldir=/usr/share/doc/xz-utils-9999/html --with-sysroot=/ 
--libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-threads --enable-nls --disable-static 
--enable-encoders=lzma1,lzma2 --enable-decoders=lzma1,lzma2 
--enable-match-finders=hc3,hc4,bt4 --enable-checks=crc32,crc64
```

This results in the following test failures on master as of today:
```

The tests pass if I turn 'extra-filters' back on.

Thanks for reporting this. Can you attach your entire test-suite.log
file? I am wondering why test_files.sh and test_compress_* skips
instead of fails on your configuration. Fixing the test_bcj_exact_size
issue is simple and I already submitted a patch for it to Lasse.
test_files.sh and test_compress_* deserve a proper rewrite, but that
probably will not happen before 5.4.0 so the short term solution may
be to have them skip if the configurations differ to far from the
default.

Sure!

Let me know if you need any more data.

Thanks! That should be all that I need. It looks like from your
current build script the multilib_src_configure does not build xz and
xzdec, so that explains why the script tests are skipped. I see that
our skip messages from the scripts could be a little more helpful in
the future...
