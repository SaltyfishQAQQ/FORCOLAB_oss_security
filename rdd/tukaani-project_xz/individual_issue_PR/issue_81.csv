I couldn't find even one project that uses XZ Utils binaries.
Please give me a link to project where I can download Latest compiled binaries.",['vectoris']

Gentoo, Slackware, and Ubuntu include XZ Utils. FreeBSD includes
XZ Utils in the base system. OpenBSD provides a prebuilt package.

I hope this helps.

If you were looking for binaries for non-free operating systems like
Windows, then I don't have a recommendations for up-to-date binaries.
The XZ Utils home page has binaries for 5.2.9. I'm hoping to include
updated simplified build instructions for Windows in XZ Utils 5.6.0, if
I have time.",['vectoris']

The thought of starting to provide official binaries again has been
considered for a while. The package build script etc. have been updated
recently and hopefully get merged to master this week. There are some
non-technical considerations to decide but there is a possibility (so
it's still very uncertain) that XZ Utils 5.6.0 might get a Windows
binary package as well.

commented,Larhzu,2025-01-23T18:34:45Z,"The 5.6.4 release includes Windows binaries. They have been built against UCRT instead of MSVCRT.

I don't know if next releases will include Windows binaries. If the 5.6.4 ones are useful to you, please comment here, on IRC, or send an email.",['Geo25rey']
