Trying to install xz_utils via conan -

commented,Larhzu,2024-01-14T15:44:13Z,"Seems to work fine at the moment. The hosting provider had reported that a denial of service attack happened 2-3 days ago.

The 5.4.2 release is available on GitHub and also on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lzmautils/files/). Future release will use github.com as the primary download URL for unrelated reasons.",['snweiss']
