thread_started,Alcaro,2024-03-29T21:18:50Z,"Some of them claim to fix actual bugs and/or improve test coverage, but it's unclear to me if they're bugs in the actual XZ project, or if they're fallout from the backdoor.

For this kind of situation, I'd rather err on the side of deleting too much. If they were helpful, the bugs can be re-reported and re-fixed.

I only checked up to and including https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commits?author=JiaT75&after=af071ef7702debef4f1d324616a0137a5001c14c+104 ; everything on that page looks clean to me, so I believe the user only became malicious somewhere after that point.",['Alcaro']
commented,ghost,2024-03-29T21:44:04Z,LGTM! :P,['Alcaro']
commented,thesamesam,2024-03-29T21:45:33Z,"I wouldn't do https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/95/commits/71ff4e23932ed8eb9be8d6dbb8e5413fb11e3cd2. As I mention in the commits somewhere, the change is right to begin with. See https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=114115.

But I don't object strenuously - we can always redo it later.

I haven't checked the reverts do what they say they do, but the list sounds right to me.",['ghost']
commented,Alcaro,2024-03-29T22:04:03Z,"Yes, this PR is bigger than necessary. It's intentional; for issues of this nature, I'd rather purge everything related with a wide margin. Better safe than sorry.

The bug report tells how to trigger that issue; once the dust settles, it will be easy to rerun the reproduction steps and see if it still crashes, and if yes, someone uninvolved can create a new fix, or revert the revert.",['thesamesam']
commented,ItzSwirlz,2024-03-29T22:23:16Z,"Honestly, might be best to revert all commits in the past 3 months or so, or just find an older tagged version that hasn't probably been force pushed. It's possible that the bad actor modified old commit logs and whatnot",['Alcaro']
commented,naikel,2024-03-29T22:48:09Z,"@Alcaro why are you changing the correct word ""function"" to ""funcion"" and also naming the commit as ""fixing a typo""?

You're introducing a typo instead.

EDIT: I can see you're only reverting commits.",Alcaro
commented,theCapypara,2024-03-29T22:49:39Z,@naikel Those are reverts. The original commits fixed the typo. They were reverted.,naikel
commented,Alcaro,2024-03-29T22:59:21Z,"It was easier to revert the entire commit than only revert parts of it.

That entire line is removed in a subsequent commit (1efea8d8ec96676850341532970f90ec9db7d964), so the end result is the same.",['theCapypara']

commented,JustinBDev,2024-03-29T23:06:27Z,"May be overkill to suggest, but before this get merged we should get confirmation one way or another that the threat is no longer active/functional **on this puReq**

That said, @Alcaro , great initiative!",Alcaro

3 months of work though, oof, https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/685094b8e1c1aa1bf934de0366ca42ef599d25f7

lets get this merged, every state of xz is better than what we have now",['TruncatedDinoSour']

yeah, if anything we can fix later, this at least rules out the malicious commits, i +1 the 'merge it now and see later' idea rn",['lcarilla']

i'm not, i'm just trying to be active and stay up to date with the situation whilst giving my input on this, looking for ways to contribute to resolving this asap as i also use this project,, i've looked through jias commits trying to find anything suspicious, skimming through it didn't uncover much and paying a bit more attention to it didn't uncover much either, i did found an xz-related kernel patch though fairly recently : https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240320183846.19475-1-lasse.collin@tukaani.org/t/",tukaani
