Additional changes:
* bumped checkout action to v3 (not really critical, but I did while trying to understand build failure)
* fixed ""false positive"" uninitialized warning with empty in stream_encoder.c
* fixed missing include in memcmplen.h, because this include is not provided if --disable-threads is requested for build

Windows build run is very slow (comparing to others), but I don't think it could be somehow improved.",['arixmkii']
