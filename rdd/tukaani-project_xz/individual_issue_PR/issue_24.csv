Not necessarily a bug, but the behavior is confusing. lzma_str_to_filters() is successful with the filter string ""lzma1"" when LZMA_STR_ALL_FILTERS flag is used, as expected. However, lzma_str_to_filters() fails with ""lzma1"" when LZMA_STR_NO_VALIDATION. This is confusing because the ""validation"" is too vague. Checking if a filter can be used with the .xz format is technically validation. So, either the code should change or the documentation should be updated to clarify this.
