Jia Tan,Vincent Fazio,pr_32.csv,"@vfazio Thanks for the bug report and PR! I am not familiar with the Microblaze platform and I am surprised that `__has_attribute` can report a false positive like this.

Do you know if GCC on Microblaze supports symver? I am asking because if  `__attribute__((__symver__ ...))` is not supported then `__asm__("".symver "" ...)` is used instead with your patch. If symver is not supported on Microblaze, then the better solution would be to disable HAVE_SYMBOL_VERSIONS_LINUX in configure.ac (and in CMakeLists.txt) for Microblaze.

By the way, as a temporary workaround, you can configure with --disable-symbol-versions and the build should work.",positive,0.659032
