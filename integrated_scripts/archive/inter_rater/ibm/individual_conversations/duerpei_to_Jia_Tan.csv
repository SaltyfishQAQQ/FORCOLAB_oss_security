As you mentioned, it is a cross-compile situation where I want to copy over the test binaries after everything else is built. 
To be precise, I want to add ""ptest"" support for xz in ""openembedded core"", so there is the situations where only local compilation is done without running tests.

I have tried the method you suggested and it can also solve my problem very well, so there is no need to modify the code in xz.
Finally, I would like to thank you for your patient comment. 
Thank you!",positive,0.711327
