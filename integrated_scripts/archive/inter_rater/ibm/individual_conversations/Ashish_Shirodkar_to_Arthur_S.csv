I was trying to compile XZ with cmake(included in Visual Studio 2022) and below was my observation:

**Step 1: Set build environment**

```
D:\build>""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat""
**********************************************************************
** Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt v17.6.4
** Copyright (c) 2022 Microsoft Corporation
**********************************************************************
[vcvarsall.bat] Environment initialized for: 'x64'

D:\build>
```

**Step 2: Configure build environment:**

`D:\build>cmake -S xz-master -B xz-build`

**Setp 3: Start build:**
`D:\build>cmake --build xz-build --config Release`

**Result:**
```
D:\build>dir xz-build\Release
 Volume in drive D is New Volume
 Volume Serial Number is DE48-AF3E

 Directory of D:\build\xz-build\Release

10/19/2023  03:22 AM    <DIR>          .
10/19/2023  03:22 AM    <DIR>          ..
10/19/2023  03:21 AM           498,446 liblzma.lib
10/19/2023  03:22 AM           230,912 xz.exe
10/19/2023  03:22 AM            86,016 xzdec.exe
               3 File(s)        815,374 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  214,589,665,280 bytes free

D:\build>
```

I found **liblzma.dll** is not getting generated.

Then I configured using:
`D:\build>cmake -S xz-master -B xz-build -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`

And the **liblzma.dll** was generated.

Looks like you need to put following in CMakeLists.txt:
`option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ""Build shared libraries"" ON)`
Most opensource libs like **libxml2** have this ON by default. And before cmake when I compiled XZ it was generating liblzma.dll by default.
