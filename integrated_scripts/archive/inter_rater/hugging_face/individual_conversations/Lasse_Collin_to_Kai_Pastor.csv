Lasse Collin,Kai Pastor,issue_68.csv,"@dg0yt @Neumann-A @teo-tsirpanis: There are quite a few changes to CMake support in the `master` branch now, including renaming most of the options to use `XZ_` prefix. Hopefully it's possible to implement vcpkg's `BUILD_TOOLS` on top of the `XZ_TOOL_foo` options. I suppose these are too big changes for 5.6.x so they won't be in a stable release until 5.8.0. I'm highlighting you just in case you wish to give feedback now when it's easy to change things instead of when these are already in a stable release. Thanks!",neutral,0.06563610769808292
