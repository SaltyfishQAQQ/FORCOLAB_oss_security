Jia Tan,Anton Kochkov,issue_48.csv,"Thanks for the bug report! I created a new branch [tuklib integer fix](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/tree/tuklib_integer_fix) with a potential fix for this. Can you test this to see if it builds correctly? Only the first commit should be needed for this bug, but the second should possibly silence some warnings for other users (MSVC builds).

Also, I noticed in the liblzma.wrap file that you linked uses a different mirror to pull the release. I would advise against this, since that mirror is not affiliated with us and is not as up to date as this repository. The hashes between the tag on the mirror and the tukaani.org link are different because the GitHub generated .tar.gz does not go through the same release steps that our official source code release does. For your purposes, the differences from the source code release are probably not important since they are mostly for users building with Autotools. We sign both the tags and the source code release, so either should be secure. We have released 5.4.2 a few weeks ago, so 5.4.1 is no longer the most recent stable release.",neutral,0.12119554355740547
