Jia Tan,Xin Li,pr_43.csv,"Hi @delphij! Thanks for the notifying us about the issue and for the PR. I solved it a slightly different way with the newest commits on master to avoid unneeded function calls after ENOSYS and to issue a warning message. Can you verify this solves the problem? Additionally, an extra check should be added to ax_check_capsicum.m4, but that can be added later.",positive,0.24386439099907875
Jia Tan,Xin Li,pr_43.csv,"Silly mistake by me. I just pushed up [01587dd](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/01587dda2a8f13fef7e12fd624e6d05da5f9624f) with your suggestion of hiding it in the `#else` clause.

This seems like the most efficient solution, although I'm guessing compilers would be smart enough to optimize the jump out of your second suggestion.

Hopefully it works this time! Let me know if there are any other issues.",neutral,0.0058834850788116455
