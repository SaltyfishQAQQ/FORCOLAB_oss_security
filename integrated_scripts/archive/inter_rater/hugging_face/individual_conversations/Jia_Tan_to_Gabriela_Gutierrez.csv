Everything looks great except can you tweak your commit messages slightly? If you could prepend ""CI:"" before the first line of your commit message (""Bump and ref actions..."") that would be great. We like to do that to help search/filter commits by category. Also, in the first commit can you mention the reason why this change is needed? Something like the text from #65 could be enough:

""Referencing actions by commit SHA in GitHub workflows guarantees you are using an immutable version. Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.""

Or if you want to reword it at all.",positive,0.8282316639088094

Jia Tan,Gabriela Gutierrez,issue_38.csv,"Hi Gabriela!

Thank you for notifying us about this important security practice. I had not set the more restrictive Workflow permissions, so I have just updated the default to be read-only. Our CI tests are quite simple, so read-only is enough permissions for us.

Specifying the permissions explicitly in the ci.yml file probably isn't needed now that the default permissions have been updated, but it also doesn't hurt. I suppose it will keep us safe in case GitHub updates their default permission policy. If you submit a PR to update it, I will be happy to review and accept it :)

XZ Utils is still new to GitHub, so if you have any other security recommendations for us, please notify us.",positive,0.8684533310588449
Jia Tan,Gabriela Gutierrez,pr_47.csv,"Thanks for the PR! I recently enabled GitHub's Security Advisories feature so we should list that as a reporting option. Email is the preferred option, so we should list that option first. 

Can you move the SECURITY.md to the .github folder? Since this is a GitHub specific file and the rest of our documentation is .txt files, this would fit better.

The 90 day timeline to fix security reports is plenty of time for us, so I think that is very reasonable for us to adhere to.",positive,0.8550700556952506

Jia Tan,Gabriela Gutierrez,issue_65.csv,"Hello!

Thanks again for the security advice. I suppose the only downside for this is not receiving potential bugfixes for the version we reference for the action. This can be mitigated by me not being lazy and subscribing to receive notifications when these repositories publish a release, so I have done that :)

Feel free to provide a PR for this. I believe all that needs changing is:

ci.yml
- actions/checkout
- actions/upload-artifact

windows-ci.yml
- actions/checkout
- actions/upload-artifact
- msys2/setup-msys2",neutral,0.10036276280879974
Jia Tan,Gabriela Gutierrez,issue_65.csv,"The issues preventing Windows-CI from passing have been fixed on master. There were actually two problems, both related to Clang 17.0.1 release.

Jia Tan,Gabriela Gutierrez,pr_66.csv,"@gabibguti It looks like Windows CI is broken on the master branch, so thanks for letting us know. I have it set it up to only run manually because it runs much slower than Ubuntu and Mac OS runners. I suppose I should manually run it more often.

We have been doing a few Windows related changes for xz recently so thats likely what broke it. I will investigate the issue and let you know when  it is fixed.",negative,-0.40812426060438156
