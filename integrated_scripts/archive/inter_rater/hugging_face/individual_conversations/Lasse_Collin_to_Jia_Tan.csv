A few thoughts about 32-bit x86: Testing on modern 64-bit processor running 32-bit code was what I had in mind, so that part is fine. The results look strange though.

The 32-bit assembly code implements the same algorithm as the generic C code. The CLMUL version should easily be faster with 1024-byte buffers, even if those were unaligned.

With GCC 3.3/3.4 I remember that GCC couldn't fit all hot variables in registers and the resulting extra stack access was bad for speed. On x86-64 this isn't a problem anymore. My expectation is that the 32-bit x86 assembly code for CRC32 should have similar speed as the generic C code has on x86-64. I don't have clear expectations of the speed of the C code on 32-bit x86.

On 32-bit x86, CRC64 benefits more from CLMUL because 32-bit x86 doesn't have 64-bit general-purpose registers. With the generic method, including the assembly implementation, the 64-bit CRC value needs two registers and updating it needs more instructions.

I wondered if eight xmm registers could be a limiting factor on 32-bit x86. However, on x86-64 exactly eight xmm registers are used by both CRC32 and CRC64 CLMUL implementations with GCC 13.2.1. So I suppose the number of xmm registers shouldn't be a problem.

We (or likely it's mostly Jia) will do a few tests later.

Thanks again!",positive,0.8539174264296889
Lasse Collin,Jia Tan,issue_61.csv,"There's now a little more information in the NVD. The [entry in Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-22916) is somewhat informative:


That makes me wonder if it could have been a file which uses a 4 GiB LZMA2 dictionary and thus needs lots of RAM even in single-threaded mode. xz has had memory usage limiting options for such files since the first stable version because high memory usage could be a denial of service. Strict limits (which would make xz refuse to decompress) aren't enabled by default because of the strong feedback I got before 5.0.0 was released: a too low limit can also result in a denial of service. The [Memory usage](https://tukaani.org/xz/man/xz.1.html#DESCRIPTION:_Memory_usage) section on the xz man page has been there since 5.0.0 too.

This was just a guess; the CVE could be about something else, of course. With the information I currently have, I consider this CVE to be incorrect (not a bug or a security issue).",neutral,-0.025637117214500904
Lasse Collin,Jia Tan,issue_61.csv,"The snappyJack repository is available again. It contains a corrupt .lzma file which uses a tiny 256-byte dictionary. So decompression needs very little memory. The reporter claims that decompressing it ""could cause endless output"".

Both XZ Utils and even the long-deprecated LZMA Utils produce 114,881,179 bytes of output from the payload before reporting an error. This is not ""endless output"". The decompression speed is good too.

There is no denial of service or other bug with this file.",neutral,0.12450704351067543
Lasse Collin,Jia Tan,issue_68.csv,"Quite a few changes have been made to CMake support in the `master` branch in the past week. For example, configuration variables have been renamed and added. A few changes are pending still.

Question: How old CMake version should be supported? Currently 3.14 is the minimum except that 3.20 is required to support message and man page translations and to create a relocatable `liblzma.pc`. **Is it OK to require CMake 3.20** in XZ Utils 5.8.0 (and 5.7.1alpha)?",neutral,-0.0017285114154219627

Lasse Collin,Jia Tan,pr_53.csv,"My understanding is that ifunc is specific to glibc. `__constructor__` works on many ELF platforms, not just GNU/Linux.

According to your link, ifunc is incompatible with `-fsanitize=address`. And indeed it makes `make check` fail with segfaults. (I also see that two tests fail with `-fsanitize=address` before your patch due to memory leaks but no segfaults.)

Also, checking for `__cplusplus` isn't needed as this is C code and not a public header.

How much difference (speed or memory or anything else) does ifunc make in this specific use case? I understand that the function pointer is an extra step on each call but the function itself is more expensive than `memcpy` or such which get called a lot with tiny buffers. Currently I feel the extra complication isn't worth it in liblzma as `__constructor__` is good to keep around too for ELF platforms that lack ifunc support.

Lasse Collin,Jia Tan,pr_43.csv,"@JiaT75: I apologize for the inappropriate harsh message above. I shouldn't post when in bad mood.

@delphij: OK, so avoiding non-zero exit status is essential.

Is a warning message good or bad? I thought it's not good to print a warning on `ENOSYS` since the reason for the error is clearly outside of xz (kernel or emulator not supporting the syscall) and it could be annoying if all Capsicum processes showed such warnings on every invocation. But it can be argued that it's good to inform users about the situation.

If cap_rights_limit(2) can return `ENOSYS` then I suppose it doesn't hurt to check it even after a successful call to cap_enter(2).

Other OSes with Capsicum support I hadn't thought about. So I guess for now it's simplest to avoid capsicum_helpers(3).

I tested the new cap_rights_limit calls on FreeBSD 13.1 and they seem to work even with `sysctl kern.trap_enotcap=1` so I guess they *might* be safe to add even to the next stable release but it can be decided later.",negative,-0.5284865209832788
