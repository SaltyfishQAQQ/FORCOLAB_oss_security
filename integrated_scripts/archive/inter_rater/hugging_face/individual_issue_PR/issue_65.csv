Referencing actions by commit SHA in GitHub workflows guarantees you are using an immutable version. Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.

Although there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.

If you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.

### Expected Complications

None.

### Will I try to implement this new feature?

Yes

##### Additional Context

Hi! I'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)",v3

Thanks again for the security advice. I suppose the only downside for this is not receiving potential bugfixes for the version we reference for the action. This can be mitigated by me not being lazy and subscribing to receive notifications when these repositories publish a release, so I have done that :)

Feel free to provide a PR for this. I believe all that needs changing is:

ci.yml
- actions/checkout
- actions/upload-artifact

windows-ci.yml
- actions/checkout
- actions/upload-artifact
- msys2/setup-msys2",gabibguti
commented,gabibguti,2023-09-26T14:19:32Z,"Hi Jia! Ok, nice, I'll open a PR! And yes, there's this downside of having to keep an eye to update the actions. You can update it manually or there's also the option to use [dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) or [renovatebot](https://docs.renovatebot.com/#why-use-renovate).",JiaT75
commented,JiaT75,2023-09-29T14:50:57Z,"The issues preventing Windows-CI from passing have been fixed on master. There were actually two problems, both related to Clang 17.0.1 release. If you are curious, [this](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/0570308ddd9c0e39e85597ebc0e31d4fc81d436f) and [this](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/01e34aa1171b04f8b28960b1cc6135a903e0c13d) are the commits. The related bugs for Clang are in the commit messages :)

So feel free to continue your work on a PR now that the issues are resolved. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!",gabibguti
