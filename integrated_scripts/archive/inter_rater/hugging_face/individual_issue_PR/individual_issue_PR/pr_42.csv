All of the targets that need to be compiled require C99, so it would be better to just set the CMAKE_C_STANDARD variable at the top of CMakeLists.txt like this:

```
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
```"
commented,autoantwort,2023-02-27T12:40:38Z,Do the headers also require C99 or only the source code?
commented,JiaT75,2023-02-27T13:09:18Z,"The liblzma API headers should be compatible with C89, but the internal headers used by the source code are not. "
commented,JiaT75,2023-02-27T16:45:14Z,"This should be fixed as of commit 4b7fb3bf41a0ca4c97fad3799949a2aa61b13b99 on master. @autoantwort can you let us know if this does not solve the bug?

This will be in a new stable 5.4.2 release in the near future. Thanks again for reporting this!"
