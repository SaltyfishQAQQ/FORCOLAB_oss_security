Thanks for the PR. Could you please separate this into two separate commits? One for the typo fix in `file_io.c` and another for the typo fixes in the test files. 

In the commit messages, the first should be prefixed with ""xz:"" instead of ""Docs:"". We use the ""Docs:"" prefix when referring to changes to things like the README, man pages, INSTALL, etc. The second commit should be prefixed with ""Tests:""."
