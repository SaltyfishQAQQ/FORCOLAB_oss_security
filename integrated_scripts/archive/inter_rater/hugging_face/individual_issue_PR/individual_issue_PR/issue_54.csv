When cross-compiling to Windows (for example from either Linux or MacOS to Windows, using mingw-w64), I'd like to be able to run the `make check` suite in a Windows guest in a VM. For this to be possible, I'd need that the tests executables and scripts be copied (or installed) to a given directory, which I could have set up as a shared folder with a virtual machine.

The current behaviour when you cross-compile and issue a `make check`, is that all test programs are built, but then they are executed (which obviously fails, as you are cross compiling).

If your build system was plain Makefiles, I'd happily volunteer to implement this feature, but I have no Autotools knowledge, so I'm afraid I cannot help writing it.

Perhaps a good way of implementing this would be to add a switch to configure, so that when that switch is present, all the test programs are built but not executed, and are also installed when you do a `make install`. The only problem I see is that I'm not sure if the main script that runs all tests could be saved as a normal script file or if you are running all the tests directly from the Makefile generated by `configure`.

### Expected Complications

_No response_

### Will I try to implement this new feature?

No"

commented,cblc,2023-06-29T17:00:18Z,"Great, thank you very much!

Does the test suite consist in invoking the following executables, or do I need to invoke them in some special way, or are there perhaps other scripts to run? (these executables are what I get in the tests directory when building to 32bit Windows with mingw-w64)

```
tests/create_compress_files.exe	tests/test_check.exe		tests/test_hardware.exe		tests/test_lzip_decoder.exe	tests/test_vli.exe
tests/test_bcj_exact_size.exe	tests/test_filter_flags.exe	tests/test_index.exe		tests/test_memlimit.exe
tests/test_block_header.exe	tests/test_filter_str.exe	tests/test_index_hash.exe	tests/test_stream_flags.exe
```"
commented,cblc,2023-06-30T09:13:35Z,"Everything clear, I think. I have created this batch file which, AFAIK, runs all the tests that can be run from cross-compilation.

There's an extra step, though, before running this batch file, and it's that you must copy the complete `files` folder (located under the `tests` folder in the source code) into the built `tests` folder, for the script to run:

```
test_bcj_exact_size.exe || exit /b
test_block_header.exe || exit /b
test_check.exe || exit /b
test_filter_flags.exe || exit /b
test_filter_str.exe || exit /b
test_hardware.exe || exit /b
test_index.exe || exit /b
test_index_hash.exe || exit /b
test_lzip_decoder.exe || exit /b
test_memlimit.exe || exit /b
test_stream_flags.exe || exit /b
test_vli.exe || exit /b
```

commented,JiaT75,2023-07-17T16:56:02Z,Thanks @cblc for reporting this! We had a similar report recently (mentioned by @thesamesam) so we made a much needed update to the INSTALL file. I hope this update helps you and future users with similar questions.
