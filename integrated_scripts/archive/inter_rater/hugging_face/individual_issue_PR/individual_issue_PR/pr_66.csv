`windows-ci` is failing in my fork. I tested it on the [last commit it was working](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/bf65f25ac8fa8b6686459c004759d8b77ba17502) without changes and it failed too, maybe it needs some data only the original repository has?"
commented,gabibguti,2023-09-26T16:44:52Z,An idea to fix `windows-ci`: I can add a trigger to run `on: pull_request` in my fork and test if the workflow is working on this PR.
commented,gabibguti,2023-09-26T17:27:47Z,"I think the failure is not related to the PR changes, can you confirm by running the workflow on the repository?"
commented,gabibguti,2023-09-26T17:54:41Z,Closing this PR to make more tests locally.
commented,JiaT75,2023-09-27T12:27:59Z,"@gabibguti It looks like Windows CI is broken on the master branch, so thanks for letting us know. I have it set it up to only run manually because it runs much slower than Ubuntu and Mac OS runners. I suppose I should manually run it more often.

We have been doing a few Windows related changes for xz recently so thats likely what broke it. I will investigate the issue and let you know when  it is fixed."
commented,gabibguti,2023-09-27T18:39:23Z,"Ok, thanks for the confirmation, Jia!"
