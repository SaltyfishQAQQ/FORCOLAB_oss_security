I'm not very familiar with the GitHub workflows files. Running spellcheck automatically could make sense, on the other hand it's easy to run it manually every once in a while.

I gave up with spellcheckers a very long time ago as the false positives were too annoying. I know I've made quite a few spelling errors over the years though and other people have sent fixes. So I might run codespell now and then in the future.

Note that I'm not able to reopen this PR as GitHub suspended most forks the xz repository.

Thanks!",['yarikoptic']
