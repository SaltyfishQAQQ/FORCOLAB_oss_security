The translation is not handled yet.
Currently running po4a/update-po upon commit 5d8d915ebe2e345820a0f54d1baf8d7d4824c0c7 generates changes of over 455 lines and I'm sure sure if they are really needed. Plus, I'm not familiar with the po4a tools so help is needed. ",['ivq']
commented,JiaT75,2024-02-26T12:20:07Z,"Thanks for the PR! This was indeed forgotten. There is no need to worry about the translations. Those are handled by the [Translation Project](https://translationproject.org/domain/xz-man.html).

I don't think anything else is needed for this PR, so when you are satisfied with the PR you can mark it Ready for review :)",['ivq']
