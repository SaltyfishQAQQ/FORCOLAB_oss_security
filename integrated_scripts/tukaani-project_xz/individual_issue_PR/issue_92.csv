commented,nickodell,2024-03-29T18:57:24Z,"@rubyFeedback


It depends on how exactly you downloaded the file. If you went onto the [Releases](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases) page and downloaded the tarball, then you have the vulnerability. You can see this by opening one of the tar files, and opening m4/build-to-host, and looking at line 63, which is the same line that the openwall announcement says is part of the backdoor.

On the other hand, if you went to the home page, and you clicked on a tag, then clicked ""download zip,"" then you got the files that are in Git, which are different than the release tarball. You would not be affected by the vulnerability in that case. (Unless there is some other backdoor that we haven't found yet.)",rubyFeedback

The code to trigger the exploit code was only added in the release tarball and gated behind various conditions.

That doesn't mean other malicious things didn't happen in the past and deeper analysis is still being worked on to see if other triggers might have been present. The presently known and understood trigger was only recently activated and added to the tarballs.",nickodell

commented,lietu,2024-03-29T20:13:10Z,"So I found it a bit strange that people only mention `ssh` as potentially affected by `liblzma`, so I made a quick bash script that loops through files in `/usr/lib` + `/lib` checking with `ldd` for references to `liblzma.so.5`, and then adds that file to a growing list of potential worries, then scans `/usr/bin` + `/bin` + `/usr/local/bin` for binaries that `ldd` says uses any of those potentially problematic libraries and .. well .. the list isn't short.

It includes stuff like `lxc`, `NetworkManager`, `nmap`, `llvm`, `qemu`, `clang`, `plasma` and `kde`, `pgrep`, `kmod`, `cupsd`, `lspci`, `file`, `dosbox`, `smbd`, `dockerd`, `xmlsec`, overall a lot of generic desktop software as well as incredibly commonplace system utilities. I didn't investigate the vulnerability in detail but with a quick look it seems the potential ramifications of this malicious actor's commit history are a bit larger than initially suspected, especially if `ssh` was affected just because of some connection to `libsystemd`, as quite a large % of my system's binaries depend on `liblzma.so.5`.

https://gist.github.com/lietu/c9b3fc27642d59edb375edc3b4a16c72

    Lasse Collin (Larzhu) who has maintained xz since the beginning (~2009), and before that, lzma-utils.
    Jia Tan (JiaT75) who started contributing to xz in the last 2-2.5 years and gained commit access,
    and then release manager rights, about 1.5 years ago.
