Andreas MÃ¼ller,Lasse Collin,issue_18.csv,"Good point, I wasn't aware of that assembly code. I did a quick test on a virtual windows 10:

MSVC against clang-cl (needed ~~a couple of code adaptions~~ one include for _get_osfhandle).

1. uncompressable 40MB input 
2. compressable 214MB input (compressed =24.3MB)

using xz with all default settings (xz.exe -z raw, xz.exe -d raw.xz) and took the timings:

1: almost identical (differences <2%)
2: compressing is similar (<2%), decompressing: clang-cl is 10% to 15% faster

I will bench with a ""real"" windows later and update here

update: i see a performance increase of up to 25% on windows 11 AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U. ",positive,0.7553451261483133
