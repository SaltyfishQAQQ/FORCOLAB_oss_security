I'll do it tomorrow.


The specification says 64-bit LoongArch chips shall implement CRC32 instructions, but 32-bit LoongArch chips may lack them (though no 32-bit LoongArch chips have been launched as at now).",neutral,-0.004385447129607201

It's likely to be made but we are so unsure about some details of it (and whether we need some GCC flags for attributes for it).  So I've modified the code to 64-bit-only and removed runtime detection for now. ",neutral,-0.1921917824074626

Some low-end 64-bit LoongArch CPUs (2K1000 for example) do not support unaligned access, on these CPUs unaligned access will trap and be emulated by the kernel (very slow).  So we have to adjust the alignment anyway...  I don't have a 2K1000 board for testing though, on my board (3A6000) the alignment adjustment only produces ~1% improvement.",neutral,0.009448226541280746
