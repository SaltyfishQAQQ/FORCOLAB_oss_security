Thank your for the PR. I have been wanting to add MSVC support to xz but have not had the time yet. Unfortunately this cannot be accepted in its current state because many things are preventing this from building with MSVC.

First, there are no build system changes. We are moving away from supporting the Visual Studio Solution Files starting with the upcoming 5.6.0 release planned for the end of this year. Instead we would like our Windows users to use CMake instead to generate the Visual Studio files.

Second, there are functions that I don't think Visual Studio default C libraries support. Specifically the functions in mytime.c would still need to be ported for this to compile.

I did not try to build this yet since the build system changes were not made. I did not review closely yet the changes that were made to alias functions and structs in file_io.* so I cannot comment one way or another on those.

I don't mean to discourage your efforts on this. I do want xz to build with MSVC eventually but it should be done small stages. The first stage I would start with is by adding CMake support for getopt_long() replacement. The Autotools build has support for this and the replacement files are in /lib. The next stage could be porting the file_io functions, perhaps what you have already works for that. Then maybe the mytime.c functions. Eventually, we can remove the ""NOT MSVC"" check for CMake building the xz target in CMakeLists.txt when we are confident things are working well.",negative,-0.46767861023545265
