I hope this helps.

If you were looking for binaries for non-free operating systems like
Windows, then I don't have a recommendations for up-to-date binaries.
The XZ Utils home page has binaries for 5.2.9. I'm hoping to include
updated simplified build instructions for Windows in XZ Utils 5.6.0, if
I have time.",positive,0.2807935532182455

The thought of starting to provide official binaries again has been
considered for a while. The package build script etc. have been updated
recently and hopefully get merged to master this week. There are some
non-technical considerations to decide but there is a possibility (so
it's still very uncertain) that XZ Utils 5.6.0 might get a Windows
binary package as well.
