fixes.


Quite possibly so. I agree it should be configurable.


It is clear that the compiler doesn't support symbol versioning in any
form. The linker still does, thus thus the ""generic"" versioning works.


As you noticed, the additional symbols didn't appear. The correct way
is to use the ""generic"" versioning which doesn't even attempt to add
those extra symbol versions. This is assuming that the toolchain truly
is targeting glibc (configure thinks it is).


configure and CMakeLists.txt could check for __NVCOMPILER. I suppose
that would be reasonable. I plan to add that in the near future, unless
the problem is that the build isn't actually targeting glibc and
configure is misdetecting that.

Not very many users should be affected by changing from ""linux"" to
""generic"". The ""linux"" one only helps with binary compatibility with
some executables which hopefully aren't too common.


It's simplest to just ignore --enable-symbol-versions in this case.
Symbol versions make no sense in static libraries but they can cause
breakage in some cases. If we rejected the option with static-only
builds it could complicate build scripts that use mostly the same
options for building shared and static liblzma in separate runs.",positive,0.2932506315410137

Lasse Collin,Sergey Kosukhin,pr_91.csv,"The code selected with 0x100 is the simplest assembly piece and it has
fewer input and output variables too. So it could be something about
the number of variables or the length of the assembly code but this is
just a guess.

Keeping the code disabled with NVIDIA HPC seems the simplest solution
for now. I like to make the code portable as in ""works reliably"" but
getting the best speed has some bias towards FOSS toolchains and
operating systems.

The PRs #90 and #91 are now merged to master along with related commits
that should make the symbol version autodetection work too.

Thank you for reporting the issues and for the patches!",neutral,0.06012614071369171
