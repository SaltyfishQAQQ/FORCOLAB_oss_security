ssvb,ssvb,"[{'message': ""### Describe the Feature\n\nSimilar to BCJ filters for executables, UTF-8 text compression can be also potentially improved by applying a filter before compressing data with LZMA. Each Cyrillic letter needs 2 bytes in UTF-8 format. And it's easy to demonstrate that converting UTF-8 to legacy 8-bit encoding improves compression. Some examples are below.\n\nUkrainian text is **~7%** better compressible in a 8-bit cp1124 encoding:\n```\nwget https://archive.org/stream/ukrainskakuhnya1998/ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt\niconv -f utf-8 -t CP1124//TRANSLIT ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt > ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt.cp1124\nxz -k ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt\nxz -k ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt.cp1124\nls -l ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 2860770 May 15 19:44 ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 1682011 May 15 19:47 ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt.cp1124\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb  418940 May 15 19:47 ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt.cp1124.xz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb  448944 May 15 19:44 ukrainskakuhnya1998_djvu.txt.xz\n```\n\nFinnish text is **~0.8%** better compressible in a 8-bit latin1 encoding:\n```\nwget https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/70694/pg70694.html\niconv -f utf-8 -t latin1//TRANSLIT pg70694.html > pg70694.html.latin1\nxz -k pg70694.html\nxz -k pg70694.html.latin1\nls -l pg70694*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 742324 May  4 03:00 pg70694.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 709415 May 15 19:16 pg70694.html.latin1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 223924 May 15 19:16 pg70694.html.latin1.xz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 ssvb ssvb 225720 May  4 03:00 pg70694.html.xz\n```\n\nNow regarding the filter itself. It needs to be perfectly reversible without any possible data loss during conversion. So I would suggest to use a small set of legacy 8-bit codepages, such as latin1, cp1124, cp1251 and so on. But still reserve one special character for escape sequences (to switch between the available 8-bit codepages or for injecting arbitrary binary data). I can implement a prototype of such filter if anyone is interested. But the main question is how to integrate it into XZ? And whether such filter would be accepted in principle?\n\n### Expected Complications\n\nThat's a format extension.

While the intention behind these changes may have been to improve error reporting, there are concerns about potential security implications, especially in light of the recent discovery of a backdoor in the xz utility.\n\nUpon reviewing the changes, it appears that safe fprintf calls were replaced with unsafe fprintf calls in the error handling code. This alteration raises concerns about the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities, particularly if terminal escape sequences or other forms of exploitation are inadvertently included in error messages.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the situation and the potential for similar vulnerabilities, I believe it's crucial for the project maintainers to thoroughly assess these changes and ensure that they do not inadvertently introduce security risks. Additionally, considering the recent backdoor discovery, it's important to prioritize the security and integrity of the xz utility.\n\nProposed Actions:\n\n    Revert the changes made to the error handling code, restoring the use of safe fprintf calls.\n    Use archive_errno instead of errno for error handling to mitigate potential risks associated with including terminal escape sequences in error messages.\n    Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and address any other potential security concerns.\n\nAdditional Context:\n\n    Link to the relevant MR or commit where the changes were made.\n    Reference to any discussions or concerns raised by other contributors or community members.\n    Any other relevant information or insights that could aid in understanding the issue and its implications.\n\nRequest for Response:\nI kindly request a response from the project maintainers regarding these security concerns and proposed actions.
