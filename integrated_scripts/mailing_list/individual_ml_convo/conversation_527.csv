Package xz-utils
version 5.2.5-2

Hi,


I think that this new translation could be included in a future release.

Best regards

The file is broken; due to some markup errors it produces only one of
the manpages. See the attached patch.


Lasse,  besides the markup issues, both French and German translations
are meanwhile incomplete and partially outdated. Please update
po4a/xz-man.pot, and then consider to create a kind of ""intermediate""
tarball and send it to the TP robot, requesting a new TP domain for
""xz-man"".

Sorry to all, this time I had skipped testing and checking the
translation before committing it and it broke the build (po4a failure).

I have committed your patch. Now it works. :-) Thanks!


Yes, although in context of the v5.2 branch it should be slightly less
outdated. The master is still in alpha stage and not meant for any
distribution like Debian. This is a problem with translations as it's
not clear if v5.2 or master should be translated. They don't differ
much but still. If 5.2.6 will be needed, then translating v5.2 might
make more sense, maybe.


I tried requesting for xz-man domain a year ago and that didn't go well
for a few reasons. Perhaps maybe I might dare to retry when the master
branch is getting close to becoming a stable release. Or it might be
easier to handle the man pages outside the Translation Project, we'll
see.

There are many open issues in the project that have been accumulated
over the years; translations are unfortunately just one thing. I have
many xz-related emails that I haven't answered yet. So the situation
is a bit chaotic. My life situation is now a little different and I'm
hoping I can focus on xz more now. So I'm trying to sort this, we'll
see how it goes in the next 2-4 months.

I'm hoping to commit a version of the threaded decoder in a few days.
All big FIXMEs are solved, only a few small ones to do. :-)

Gitweb is working again.
