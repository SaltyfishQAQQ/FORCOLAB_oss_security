DataOutputStream, but the import statement is still present.


Now that there is a 6 byte chunkHeader, could the 1 byte tempBuf be removed?

Fixed. Thanks!


It's better to keep it. It would be confusing to use the same buffer in
write(int) and writeChunk(). At glance it would look like that
writeChunk() could be overwriting the input.

I assumed that lz.fillWindow(buf, off, len); would always process the
1 byte. It is not a big deal, I am just trying to understand what is
going on a bit better.

Yes, but it's not immediately obvious to a new reader. Also, many other
classes have tempBuf for identical use so it's good to keep that pattern
consistent.
