Hans Jansen,Jia Tan,pr_64.csv,I have made all of the changes listed above. I am also planning to work on implementations for arm versions of crc32_clmul and crc64_clmul after this is finished.,positive,0.23036338156089187

Thank you for the update, and I agree that it should not be much extra work to incorporate the changes into the code I have already written. ",positive,0.6768505200743675

I tested the difference that using GCC and Clang made in general and found that when using Clang instead of GCC there was negligible difference.

The difference that using GCC and Clang made on the inline assembly was a 2% increase on GCC and 1% or less for Clang. Since this increase is not very significant I can get rid of the changes if you would like.

Replacing CRC_SIMD_BODY with an inline function had no change to the runtime. Ill upload the Inline function as an extra commit, and squash it once you decide which one you like better.",neutral,0.042878029868006706
Hans Jansen,Jia Tan,pr_64.csv,"While working on implementing arm support for crc_clmul I found that the processor I am using does not have support for PMULL. I am not going to continue work on this at the moment since the devices I have can't test my code, but I might continue later if I get hardware that supports this.",negative,-0.8836774155497551
