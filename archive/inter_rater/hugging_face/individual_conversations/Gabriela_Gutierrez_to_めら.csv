Gabriela Gutierrez,めら,issue_65.csv,"### Describe the Feature

Referencing actions by commit SHA in GitHub workflows guarantees you are using an immutable version. Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.

Although there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.

If you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.

### Expected Complications

None.

### Will I try to implement this new feature?

Yes
