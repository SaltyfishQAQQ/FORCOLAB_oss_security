I had no problems compiling with MSVC only (cmake and tools shipped by Visual Studio 2022). Thanks a lot for setting the cmake files up for this.

Are there any plans adding MSVC CI Builds (including binary releases) to the CI pipeline?
There is a demo for VS2022/x64 build+artifacts on the ndu2/xz fork . Testing, etc is missing but this could be a start.

I can help out on this, if there is any interest.

Yes, I think so. I added Clang-cl builds. There is just one include missing (Originally I required more patches due to my inability to properly generate the vsxproj with cmake)

Patch: https://github.com/ndu2/xz/commit/5fb2ace8369ca30c17e772ce3d4a3d6fd99e2bf1





I just updated the demo pipeline to ""somewhat complete"" state that suffices my own purposes:

 * 4 Build Configuration with Visual Studio 2022 (x64 MSVC, x86 MSVC, x64 Clang-cl, x86 Clang-cl)
 * execution of the test executables
 * publishing of xz.exe and co (disabled per default)

Well, I'm neither familiar with github actions nor with windows batch (nor powershell). But I stuck to the ""out of the box"" tools for better compatibility with VS2022/Windows only setups.

You'll find the implementation it those 2 files:

 * windows/build-with-vs2022.bat
 * .github/workflows/windows-vs2022-ci.yml


I found 13 test-executables (test_*.exe). I added calls to those in `build-with-vs2022.bat` and to the pipeline. Not sure if there is a way to standardise test-execution over all platforms w/o rewriting the tests to some test-framework?



OK. To be honest, Windows releases for v5.6.x is what brought me here at the first place :-)

Please let me know if any of this work is of your interest and how to proceed.

I'm more than happy to create PRs, adapt the scripts to the projects needs and clean things up as required. Feel also free to grab what you need.
