Arthur S,Jia Tan,issue_18.csv,"@JiaT75 I did something. At least it runs full autotools set on Windows host. I don't yet understand CMake part and also VisualStudio parts, but might be able to take another look some time later. Any additional context, what you think could help is highly appreciated.",positive,0.8189363607671112
Arthur S,Jia Tan,issue_18.csv,Hi @JiaT75  Thank you for the ping. Got it out of my focus. I will revisit the topic this weekend and update. I hope to get Windows part done.,positive,0.8845065589994192
Arthur S,Jia Tan,issue_18.csv,"@JiaT75 Could you specify which flavors of msys2 would you like to support?

There are different combinations of arch, compiler, c standard library: https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/

I had recent experience of setting GitHub workflows for Windows builds and msys2, I might be able to help.

Update 1: ""MinGw and CMake"", ok, I see that `MinGw` might mean that you are not using msys2 version of toolchain yet.

Update 2: Here is GH Action to setup msys2 https://github.com/msys2/setup-msys2 with pretty detailed README.",neutral,0.04423804208636284
