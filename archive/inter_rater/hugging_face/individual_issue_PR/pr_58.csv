commented,DimitriPapadopoulos,2023-08-01T17:36:03Z,"You're welcome. A manual step might be preferable to start with, as there are often false positives, and of course false negatives. You can install codespell using `pip install codespell` and run it locally. Create a `.codespellrc` file if you need specific configuration.

Once you are accustomed to it, you may try the [GitHub action](https://github.com/codespell-project/actions-codespell).",JiaT75
