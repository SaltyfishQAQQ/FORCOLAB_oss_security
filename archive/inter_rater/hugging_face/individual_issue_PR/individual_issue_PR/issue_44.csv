Building the multilib package for Arch Linux (https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/lib32-xz/) fails. The lines producing the error did not change recently, but the version before (5.4.1) built without problems (and still builds with current toolchain).

### Version

latest

### Operating System

Arch Linux

### Relevant log output

```shell

Arch uses --enable-werror so that's why warnings make the build fail. This is good for testing :-) although it can cause annoyances like this. It was only recently that -Wno-format-truncation could be removed from the PKGBUILD file in Arch.

It's fixed in master and v5.4 now. Thanks!"
