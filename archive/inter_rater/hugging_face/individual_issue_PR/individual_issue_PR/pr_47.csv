I've tried to keep the timelines of confirming a vulnerability report and fixing a vulnerability as open as possible. Let me know what you think and if this seems reasonable for maintainence."
commented,gabibguti,2023-04-05T17:15:35Z,"I see you also have GitHub's Security Advisories feature enabled. So we could put 2 reporting options in the Security Policy, email and the [security advisory report link](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/security/advisories/new). Does it make sense?"
commented,JiaT75,2023-04-06T13:17:30Z,"Thanks for the PR! I recently enabled GitHub's Security Advisories feature so we should list that as a reporting option. Email is the preferred option, so we should list that option first. 

Can you move the SECURITY.md to the .github folder? Since this is a GitHub specific file and the rest of our documentation is .txt files, this would fit better.

The 90 day timeline to fix security reports is plenty of time for us, so I think that is very reasonable for us to adhere to."
