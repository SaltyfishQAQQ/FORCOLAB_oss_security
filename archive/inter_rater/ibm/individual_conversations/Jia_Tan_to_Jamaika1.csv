Jia Tan,Jamaika1,pr_59.csv,"@Jamaika1 Thanks for the PR! Looks like this typo had been in the code for some time, so your fix is very appreciated.

If you would like your name to appear in the `THANKS` file, I will need the name you wish to appear there since I could not find it on your profile. If you wish to stay anonymous that is ok too :)",positive,0.843751
