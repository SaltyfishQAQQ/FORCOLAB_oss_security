Lasse Collin,Sam James,issue_70.csv,"In CMake-based build, the test for attributes both compiles and links. Perhaps the problem is that linker can omit the function as it's not used in the program.

CMakeLists.txt line 810:

```
int main(void) { return 0; }
```

I wonder if this would help:

```
int main(void) { func_ifunc(); return 0; }
```

Lasse Collin,Sam James,issue_70.csv,"My above comment is wrong. The failure is from the dynamic linker, not static linker, sorry.

Perhaps it's that GCC knows that ifunc isn't supported with musl. [config.gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/git?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=gcc/config.gcc;h=c1460ca354e8f7baea3229312b17c63bd45f760a;hb=HEAD#l3637) doesn't set `default_gnu_indirect_function` with musl. Maybe Clang/LLVM needs to learn this too if it currently doesn't warn.",negative,-0.780699
