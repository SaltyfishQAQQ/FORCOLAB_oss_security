Jia Tan,ChanTsune,pr_57.csv,"Hi! Thanks again for the very detailed PR. I looked more into wasm signal support since at first I thought it was some sort of bug that the signal emulation did not define `sigset_t` or `sigprocmask()`. This seems intentional however so your PR is certainly needed for a successful port to web assembly.

What you have so far seems like it is enough for liblzma to build, but we also should support an xz port. This should be easy to add just by following the example of VMS in src/xz/signal.*. Since the only functions in xz that use `mythread_sigmask()` it should be enough to define signals_block() and signals_unblock() as no-ops in signal.h (and remove implementation from signal.c).

Let me know if you have questions or if something else is preventing us from building xz with wasi-sdk",positive,0.705604
Jia Tan,ChanTsune,pr_57.csv,"On second thought, will be more complicated that I initially thought since `signals_init()` needs to be disabled too. I will merge what you have once I make a fix for the xz side. Thanks for you contributions!",positive,0.643076
Jia Tan,ChanTsune,pr_57.csv,"@ChanTsune We would like to add you to our THANKS file in the repository but were not sure what your name was. If you are interested in being credited in the THANKS file please let us know the name you would like credited since we could not find it on your GitHub profile.

Thanks again for your contribution!",positive,0.993924
Jia Tan,ChanTsune,pr_56.csv,"Hi! Thanks for the PR. Unfortunatly, I do not think this PR solves a problem. I am guessing the issue is with your build setup instead. If you look at `mythread.h`, the functions referenced in your error message are in the `#elif defined(MYTHREAD_POSIX)` block and should be removed by the preprocessor.

If you are using our `CMakeLists.txt`, then setting `ENABLE_THREADS=OFF` will ensure `MYTHREAD_POSIX` is never added to the compile definitions. Its possible a `make clean` or removing the `CMakeCache.txt` could solve your problem.

Compiling liblzma with WebAssembly sounds like a great project though!",positive,0.616223
Jia Tan,ChanTsune,pr_56.csv,"Thanks for the updated error message. Can I ask more about your build environment? The `<signal.h>` header file should provide definitions for `sigset_t` and `sigprocmask()` in a POSIX compliant system and the preprocessor should filter out Windows builds that do not set the `__CYGWIN__` macro.

The reason I want to avoid removing `#include ""mythread.h""` from `common.h` is
1. Avoid breaking something unexpectedly
2. It allows referencing `MYTHREAD_ENABLED` just by including `common.h`. Our `common.h` header files includes `config.h` (when building with autotools) and that contains all of the configurations. So it makes the liblzma files simpler since they only need to include `common.h` to get all configurations.

Usually only including the header files you actually need is a good idea. In this case, there are few other files that would need to include `mythread.h` for it to work. But I would like to avoid this if possible.",positive,0.374776
