Lasse Collin,Andreas MÃ¼ller,issue_18.csv,"Would Visual Studio + Clang-cl be worth trying too? The inline x86-64
assembly code in 5.6.x is compatible with GCC and Clang, so I hope that
compiling with Clang-cl would result in better decompression speed than
compiling with MSVC. (LZMA SDK has MSVC compatible assembly but then
one needs to use LZMA SDK's C code and APIs too.)",negative,-0.578798
