Jia Tan,autoantwort,pr_42.csv,"Hi! Thanks for the bug report and PR.

All of the targets that need to be compiled require C99, so it would be better to just set the CMAKE_C_STANDARD variable at the top of CMakeLists.txt like this:

```
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
```",positive,0.505194
Jia Tan,autoantwort,pr_42.csv,"This should be fixed as of commit 4b7fb3bf41a0ca4c97fad3799949a2aa61b13b99 on master. @autoantwort can you let us know if this does not solve the bug?

This will be in a new stable 5.4.2 release in the near future. Thanks again for reporting this!",positive,0.486301
