Does the test suite consist in invoking the following executables, or do I need to invoke them in some special way, or are there perhaps other scripts to run? (these executables are what I get in the tests directory when building to 32bit Windows with mingw-w64)

```
tests/create_compress_files.exe	tests/test_check.exe		tests/test_hardware.exe		tests/test_lzip_decoder.exe	tests/test_vli.exe
tests/test_bcj_exact_size.exe	tests/test_filter_flags.exe	tests/test_index.exe		tests/test_memlimit.exe
tests/test_block_header.exe	tests/test_filter_str.exe	tests/test_index_hash.exe	tests/test_stream_flags.exe

cblc,Sam James,issue_54.csv,"Everything clear, I think. I have created this batch file which, AFAIK, runs all the tests that can be run from cross-compilation.

There's an extra step, though, before running this batch file, and it's that you must copy the complete `files` folder (located under the `tests` folder in the source code) into the built `tests` folder, for the script to run:

```
test_bcj_exact_size.exe || exit /b
test_block_header.exe || exit /b
test_check.exe || exit /b
test_filter_flags.exe || exit /b
test_filter_str.exe || exit /b
test_hardware.exe || exit /b
test_index.exe || exit /b
test_index_hash.exe || exit /b
test_lzip_decoder.exe || exit /b
test_memlimit.exe || exit /b
test_stream_flags.exe || exit /b
test_vli.exe || exit /b
